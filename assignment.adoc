== Task -- Translation

What does the program do?

Write a program that acts exactly the same as the link:translate_me.pas[provided one], in your favourite language (other than Pascal).

*Hint*: "Translate" does not mean you have to rewrite it line by line.

If you only know Pascal, try translating link:translate_me.py[this one] into Pascal.

Remember to commit and push your work.

== Task -- Find a bug (and fix it)

Look at the link:findbug.py[following program], written in Python. Find the bug/s in it, and fix it/them.

Try to keep the original program structure, just fix the bug/s (do not rewrite the whole program).

== Task -- Find a bug (and fix it)... again.

Look at the link:oh-my-not-again.py[following program], written in Python. Find the bug/s in it, and fix it/them.
